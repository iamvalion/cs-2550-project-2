  --DISCLAIMER--
  I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
  by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
  code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
  or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
  I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
  in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

  --REFLECTION--
    The information in this chapter is largely just a refresher for me, since I've done a
  good amount of web development stuff in the past. The biggest takeaways I had were related
  to tables. I haven't done a ton of work with tables in my personal project, but I enjoyed
  getting acquainted with the basics of them, specifically the objectives of spanning
  multiple rows, styling different components (cell padding, etc.), and making equal-width
  columns.
    The only thing I had a bit of trouble with was making the main content area be centered
  and responsive, the latter of which I didn't care enough to see through. I also took a
  little bit of extra time deciding on a color scheme and font (Nord theme with Noto and
  Comfortaa fonts) and making it all look nice. None of that is part of the actual assignment
  though, so it didn't matter too much. All in all, I like how it turned out.

      <h2><em>Soccar</em></h2>
      <p>
        The inspiration for this haiku is one of my favorite video games,
        <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/" target="_blank">Rocket League</a>. In the words of the developer, it is
        a "high-powered hybrid of
        arcade-style soccer and vehicular mayhem". I'm obsessed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Childhood dreams combine:<br>Rockets, RC cars, soccer.<br>This is
        Rocket League!

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning about <u>cybersecurity</u> and
        <u>software engineering</u>, both in school and as a hobby. They are
        fascinating fields because I enjoy building things and immersing
        myself in the ever-changing and expanding digital world we live in. I
        very naturally gravitated toward this career path. In the past few
        years I have become more focused on digital security and privacy, as
        they need to be taken seriously when technology is evolving at such a
        rapid pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also am very interested in <u>music</u>. It's captivating,
        transcends cultural barriers, and connects people. I listen to a
        ridiculous amount of music, and I hope to eventually produce some of
        my own. Lately I was able to reconnect with some old friends, and
        we've been having jam sessions where we play our various instruments,
        do a bit of song writing, and dabble with mixing and mastering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I started <u>rock climbing</u>, specifically bouldering.
        Bouldering is type of climbing with a focus on shorter routes. This
        requires a lot of strength, technique, and problem-solving; at the
        same time, it requires very little gear, which I like. It has been a
        great experience for me, as I have been able to improve myself
        physically, mentally, socially, and even spiritually. This has
        happened as I've trained very hard, strategically overcome mental
        barriers, connected with many lovely people, and spent more time in
        nature (though most of my climbing is indoor).
